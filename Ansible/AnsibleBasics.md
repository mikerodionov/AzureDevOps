# Ansible Basics

## What is Ansible

### Automating Servers

Why do we need to automate?

- Security - consistency of configuration increases environment security
- Compliance - putting policy into code and applying it to youe servers allows consisten compliance enforcement
- Rapid deployment - defining server builds by code speeds up deployments

Security automation - integrating security policies into your server automation workflow **significantly improves the ability to scan and remediate issues** in your environment.

Configuration consistency - with a large estate of servers it is not possible to maintain consistent configuration without server automation which signifcantly eases configuration management burden and can scale for huge numbers of servers.

Provisioning - automated provisioning frees up admins to work on tasks that cannot be automated
